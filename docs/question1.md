# Optimization Strategies

The approach that I will use is as follows:

1. **Server-Side Caching**:
   - I will implement caching with Redis to store frequently accessed data such as concert details and user reservations.
   - This will help to reduce database load and speed up response times for frequently requested data.

2. **Database Optimization**:
   - Indexing the columns should be a good idea.
   - When used with the foreign keys columns (e.g. `user_id` in a reservations table), this will help improve performance when joining tables on foreign keys or when indexing columns that are frequently searched (e.g. concert name).

3. **Lazy Loading**:
   - Implement lazy loading for non-critical data.
   - Load additional information (e.g. concert details) only when the user interacts with the app instead of fetch all at once.
